Info: This skin is suppost to be a biker barney.  He has a tear in his pants, a skull on the back of his jacket and gloves.  I hope you like him I'll be making more soon.  The skin has color change but the picture for the selection screen does not show it.  If anyone can tell me how to make better .bmps for this it would be greatly appreciated.
Note: When compressing always use maximum it really helps dl times.:)
